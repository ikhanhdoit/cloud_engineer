My Steps on becoming setting up a cloud environment.

1. Creating basic account as root.

- Create an IAM user with admin policy to avoid using root when managing account.

- Set up MFA for your root user.

- Set up Billing Alerts for anything over a few dollars in CloudWatch.

- Configure the AWS CLI for your user using API credentials.
